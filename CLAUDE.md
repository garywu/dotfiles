# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Session Tracking and Workflow

## Self-Reflection and Error Prevention Protocol

### Before Starting Any Task

1. **Review Recent History**
   - Re-read the last 10-20 messages in the conversation
   - Identify any patterns of errors or corrections
   - Note specific instructions that were given and may have been forgotten

2. **Check for Common Self-Induced Errors**
   - **Path errors**: Verify file paths before using them
   - **Assumption errors**: Don't assume file contents or structure - always check
   - **Instruction drift**: Re-read the original request to ensure staying on track
   - **Context loss**: Review what was already tried to avoid repeating failures

3. **Memory Checkpoint Questions**
   - What was the user's original request?
   - What specific constraints or preferences were mentioned?
   - Have I made this type of error before in this session?
   - Am I following the established patterns in this codebase?

4. **Error Pattern Recognition**
   Common self-induced errors to watch for:
   - Forgetting to read a file before writing to it
   - Using wrong file paths or assuming directory structures
   - Ignoring user corrections and repeating the same mistake
   - Missing important context from earlier in the conversation
   - Making changes that contradict established patterns

5. **Verification Before Action**
   - Double-check file paths exist with `ls` or `find`
   - Verify assumptions about file contents with `Read` tool
   - Confirm understanding of requirements before implementing
   - Test commands in a safe way before executing destructive operations

### During Task Execution

- **Pause and reflect** when errors occur - don't just retry blindly
- **Read error messages carefully** - they often contain the solution
- **Check conversation history** when confused about requirements
- **Acknowledge patterns** - if making similar errors, adjust approach

### After Completing Tasks

- **Review what was done** against original requirements
- **Note any errors made** for future reference
- **Update relevant documentation** if patterns were discovered

## Project Management Workflow

### 0. Project Setup - Permanent Management Issues

For every new project, create these 9 permanent management issues that should **NEVER be closed**:

1. **üìã Project Roadmap & Planning** - Central planning and milestone tracking
2. **üîó Issue Cross-Reference Index** - Master list of all issue relationships
3. **üìö Research & Discovery Log** - Document all findings and investigations
4. **üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions** - Track design choices and rationale
5. **üêõ Known Issues & Workarounds** - Catalog of ongoing challenges
6. **üìñ Documentation Tasks** - Track what needs documenting
7. **üîß Technical Debt Registry** - List of improvements needed
8. **üí° Ideas & Future Features** - Backlog of enhancements
9. **üìä Project Health & Metrics** - Performance and quality tracking

### 1. System Health Check

- **Start sessions with validation** - Run `./scripts/validation/validate-packages.sh`
- **Fix any issues** before starting work
- **Check after major changes** to ensure system stays clean

### 2. Issue Management Best Practices

#### Creating Issues
- **Be specific and targeted** - One clear goal per issue
- **Use templates** - Bug, Feature, Documentation, Refactor
- **Add labels** - Priority, type, component affected
- **Link related issues** - Use "Related to #X", "Blocks #Y", "Blocked by #Z"
- **Assign milestones** - Group related work

#### Interlinking Issues
- **Reference parent issues**: "Part of #X"
- **Link dependencies**: "Requires #Y to be completed first"
- **Cross-reference**: "See also #Z for related discussion"
- **Use task lists** in parent issues:
  ```markdown
  - [ ] Sub-task 1 (#101)
  - [ ] Sub-task 2 (#102)
  - [ ] Sub-task 3 (#103)
  ```

#### Continuous Documentation
- **Comment when starting work**: "Beginning investigation of X"
- **Document findings immediately**:
  ```markdown
  Discovered that the issue is caused by:
  - Finding 1: [details]
  - Finding 2: [details]
  - Potential solution: [approach]
  ```
- **Update status regularly**: "Progress update: Completed X, working on Y"
- **Link to commits**: "Implemented in abc123"
- **Document blockers**: "Blocked by #X - waiting for resolution"

### 3. Atomic Commit Practices

#### Making Atomic Commits
- **One logical change per commit** - If you need "and" in your description, split it
- **Commit frequently** - Don't accumulate large changes
- **Complete but minimal** - Each commit should work independently
- **Test before committing** - Ensure each commit doesn't break the build

#### Commit Workflow
```bash
# After each logical change:
1. git add -p  # Stage specific changes interactively
2. git diff --staged  # Review what you're committing
3. git commit  # Write descriptive message

# Don't wait to accumulate changes!
```

#### Examples of Atomic Commits
```bash
# ‚úÖ GOOD - Atomic commits
feat(validation): add check_nix_daemon function (#71)
feat(validation): add Nix daemon status to environment check (#71)
docs: add Nix daemon explanation to troubleshooting (#71)
fix(validation): remove set -e for better error handling (#71)

# ‚ùå BAD - Too many changes in one commit
feat: add validation and fix errors and update docs (#71)
```

### 4. Implementation Phase

- **Reference the issue** being worked on
- **Make atomic commits** after each logical change
- **Comment on progress** in the issue after each commit
- **Document problems** as you encounter them
- **Create new issues** for discovered problems
- **Before committing shell scripts**: Run `make fix-shell`
- **Test each commit** independently

## Shell Script Standards

### Shebang Requirements

**ALWAYS use `#!/usr/bin/env bash`** for bash scripts, never `#!/bin/bash`:

```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - finds modern bash in PATH
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# ‚ùå WRONG - uses ancient macOS bash 3.2 from 2007
#!/bin/bash
```

**Why this matters:**
- macOS ships with bash 3.2.57 (from 2007) at `/bin/bash` for GPL licensing reasons
- Modern bash 5.2+ is installed via Nix at `~/.nix-profile/bin/bash`
- Bash 3.2 lacks many modern features like associative arrays (`declare -A`)
- Using `env bash` ensures scripts use the modern version from PATH

**Enforcement:**
- Pre-commit hook will reject commits with hardcoded bash paths
- Run `make fix-shell` before committing (includes automatic shebang fix)
- Or run `./scripts/fix-shebangs.sh` to fix just shebangs

# Committing Changes with Git

## Pre-Commit Hook Management

### Preventing Pre-Commit Failures

**ALWAYS run these commands before committing:**

```bash
# Quick fix for all common issues
make pre-commit-fix

# Or manually:
make fix-shell       # Fix shell scripts
make format          # Format all code
git add -u           # Stage fixes
```

### Common Pre-Commit Issues and Solutions

1. **Trailing Whitespace / End of File**
   - Auto-fixed by `make pre-commit-fix`
   - Or run: `pre-commit run trailing-whitespace --all-files`

2. **Shell Script Issues**
   - Auto-fixed by `make fix-shell`
   - Includes: shebang fixes, shellcheck issues, formatting

3. **Markdown Linting**
   - Most strict rules - if blocking:
   - Review with: `markdownlint CLAUDE.md`
   - Last resort: `git commit --no-verify` (use sparingly!)

4. **YAML/TOML/Nix Formatting**
   - Auto-fixed by `make format`

### Recommended Commit Workflow

```bash
# 1. Make your changes
vim file.sh

# 2. Pre-commit fix (ALWAYS DO THIS!)
make pre-commit-fix

# 3. Review what will be committed
git diff --staged

# 4. Commit with confidence
git commit -m "feat: add new feature (#123)"
```

### Emergency Bypass (Use Rarely!)

```bash
# Only when you understand why it's failing
# and plan to fix in next commit
git commit --no-verify -m "WIP: emergency commit"

# IMMEDIATELY follow with:
make pre-commit-fix
git commit -m "fix: resolve pre-commit issues"
```

## Commit Message Format

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
type(scope): description (#issue-number)

[optional body]

ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests
- `chore`: Maintain tasks, dependency updates

### Commit Process

1. **Stage changes selectively**:
   ```bash
   git add -p  # Interactive staging
   # OR
   git add specific-file.sh  # Stage specific files
   ```

2. **Review staged changes**:
   ```bash
   git diff --staged
   ```

3. **Create atomic commit**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(tools): add act for local GitHub Actions testing (#64)

   - Added act to nix/home.nix for running GH Actions locally
   - Enables testing workflows without pushing to GitHub
   - Version 0.2.78 from nixpkgs

   ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   ```

4. **Update issue immediately**:
   ```bash
   gh issue comment 64 --body "Implemented in commit abc123:
   - Added act to nix/home.nix
   - Tool allows local GitHub Actions testing
   - Next: Update documentation"
   ```

### Multi-Commit Workflow Example

```bash

```

#### Dealing with ShellCheck Issues

**IMPORTANT**: If you encounter shellcheck errors during commit:

1. **Quick Fix** (Recommended):

   ```bash
   make fix-shell
   git add -u
   git commit
   ```

2. **Manual Fix** for specific issues:
   - SC2310: Function in negation - separate the check:

     ```bash
     # Instead of: if ! command_exists foo; then
     command_exists foo
     local exists=$?
     if [[ $exists -ne 0 ]]; then
     ```

   - SC2086: Quote variables: `"$var"` instead of `$var`
   - SC2292: Use `[[ ]]` instead of `[ ]`

3. **Permanent Prevention**:
   - Always run `make fix-shell` before committing shell scripts
   - Use `shellcheck <script.sh>` while developing
   - Copy from existing scripts that already pass checks

### Environment Validation

```bash
# IMPORTANT: Run regularly to detect issues early!

# Check for duplicate packages between Nix and Homebrew
./scripts/validation/validate-packages.sh

# Auto-fix duplicate package issues
./scripts/validation/validate-packages.sh --fix

# Run comprehensive validation
./scripts/validate-all.sh

# Run with auto-fix mode
./scripts/validate-all.sh --fix

# Individual validation scripts
./scripts/validation/validate-packages.sh    # Check for duplicate packages
./scripts/validation/validate-environment.sh  # Check environment health
./scripts/validation/validate-playwright.sh   # Check Playwright installation
./scripts/validation/validate-docs.sh        # Check documentation coverage
./scripts/validation/doc-coverage-report.sh  # Generate doc coverage report

# View validation reports
ls -la logs/validation/
```

### Update Management

```bash
# Check for updates across all package managers
./scripts/check-updates.sh

# Update everything at once
./scripts/update-all.sh

# Update specific package managers
nix-channel --update && home-manager switch  # Nix/Home Manager
brew update && brew upgrade                   # Homebrew
npm update -g                                 # NPM packages

# Update Ollama specifically
brew upgrade ollama  # If installed via Homebrew
# OR
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh  # Official installer

# Clean up old versions
brew cleanup --prune=all              # Homebrew
nix-collect-garbage --delete-older-than 30d  # Nix
```

#### Package Management Notes

- **Primary strategy**: Nix-first for all development tools
- **Acceptable exceptions**: Dependencies required by Homebrew formulas (e.g., python@3.12 for ra-aid)
- **Run validation after**:
  - Installing new packages
  - Running `brew update` or `brew upgrade`
  - Major system updates
  - Suspicious PATH behavior

```

## IMPORTANT: Default Tool Usage for Claude CLI

**ALWAYS use modern CLI tools as the FIRST choice:**

### File Operations

- **USE `eza -la`** instead of `ls -la`
- **USE `fd pattern`** instead of `find . -name pattern`
- **USE `bat file`** instead of `cat file` (when showing content to user)
- **USE `dust`** instead of `du -sh`

### Search Operations

- **USE `rg pattern`** instead of `grep -r pattern .`
- **USE `rg -l pattern`** instead of `grep -rl pattern .`
- **USE `fd -e txt`** instead of `find . -name "*.txt"`

### Data Processing

- **USE `jq`** for JSON instead of grep/sed/awk
- **USE `sd 'find' 'replace'`** instead of `sed 's/find/replace/g'`
- **USE `choose 0 2`** instead of `cut -f1,3` or `awk '{print $1,$3}'`

### Interactive Tools

- **USE `gum choose`** for selection menus
- **USE `gum input`** for user input
- **USE `gum spin`** for progress indicators

### Why This Matters

The efficiency testing framework (Issue #20) proved these tools provide:

- 36% fewer keystrokes (human efficiency)
- Better defaults and discoverability
- More consistent cross-platform behavior
- Better error messages and output formatting

**Remember**: These tools are already installed. There's no compatibility concern. Use them!

## Previous Session (2025-06-19)

### Focus: Claude-Init Knowledge Transfer

1. **Analyzed dotfiles for valuable learnings**:
   - Extracted debugging experiences from Issue #15 (Astro docs)
   - Captured CI/CD platform-specific knowledge
   - Documented testing framework patterns

2. **Created comprehensive documentation for claude-init**:
   - Added 7 new documentation guides
   - Captured 3.5 hours of Astro debugging into guide
   - Documented platform-specific CI gotchas
   - Created meta-guide on learning from mistakes

3. **Transformed claude-init philosophy**:
   - Shifted from prescriptive scripts to information resource
   - Added "information over implementation" principle
   - Made debugging-to-documentation process explicit

4. **Key Contributions**:
   - `docs/debugging-and-troubleshooting.md` - Common issues
   - `docs/testing-framework-guide.md` - Complete test patterns
   - `docs/github-actions-multi-platform.md` - CI/CD guide
   - `docs/documentation-site-setup.md` - Astro lessons
   - `docs/learning-from-mistakes.md` - Knowledge capture process

### Commits

- Added linting/formatting reference documentation
- Added core design principle of information over implementation
- Added comprehensive debugging knowledge from real-world experience

## Current Session (2025-06-19)

### Completed

1. Fixed critical documentation site issues (Issue #15):

   - Resolved "only building homepage and 404 page" problem
   - Fixed cross-platform rollup dependencies in GitHub Actions
   - Solution: Added `astro sync` to build process
   - Solution: Modified GitHub Actions to regenerate package-lock.json
   - All 17 pages now build correctly

2. Updated CLAUDE.md with documentation commands

3. Created detailed GitHub issue documenting failed attempts and solution

4. Analyzed claude-init's three-branch Git workflow:
   - **stable** branch - Production releases (green)
   - **beta** branch - Weekly beta releases from main (orange)
   - **main** branch - Active development (red)
   - Automated workflows for releases and synchronization

5. Created standardization issues:
   - Issue #24: Adopt Claude-Init's Three-Branch Git Workflow
   - Issue #10 in claude-init: Enhance Git Workflow Documentation for Universal Adoption

6. Successfully implemented three-branch Git workflow:
   - Created and pushed `stable`, `beta`, and updated `main` branches
   - Updated README with workflow declaration and badges
   - All branches synchronized with latest code
   - Repository now follows claude-init's proven workflow pattern

### Key Learnings from Issue #15

- **Always run `astro sync`** before building Astro sites with content collections
- **Cross-platform CI/CD**: Be careful with package-lock.json between macOS and Linux
- **Debug process**: Check dev server first - if content works there but not in build, likely a sync issue
- **Simplicity wins**: Light theme default was better than complex CSS overrides
