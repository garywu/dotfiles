# Dotfiles Bootstrap Context

## Actions Taken
- Cloned garywu/dotfiles to ~/.dotfiles
- Enhanced README and uninstall script for better uninstall/rollback visibility
- Committed and pushed changes
- Ran the bootstrap script (`./scripts/bootstrap.sh`)

## Issue Encountered
- Nix installer failed with:
  > error: failed to bootstrap /nix
  > If you enabled FileVault after booting, this is likely a known issue with macOS that you'll have to reboot to fix.

## Troubleshooting Steps Suggested
1. **Reboot the Mac** and try the bootstrap again.
2. If it fails again, try manually creating /nix:
   ```sh
   sudo mkdir /nix
   sudo chown $(whoami) /nix
   ```
   Then re-run the Nix installer.
3. If still failing, uninstall any partial Nix install:
   ```sh
   sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/uninstall)
   sudo rm -rf /nix
   ```
   Then reboot and try again.

## Next Steps
- Reboot the Mac.
- Return to this session and continue troubleshooting or resume the bootstrap process.
