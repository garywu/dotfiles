# Search Operations - Human Efficiency Analysis

**Test Case**: Search for pattern "TODO" in current directory
**Date**: Thu Jun 19 12:14:47 CDT 2025
**Context**: Comparing cognitive load and typing effort

## Character Count Analysis

### Traditional grep
```bash
grep -r "TODO" .    # 22 characters
```

### Modern ripgrep
```bash
rg "TODO"           # 14 characters
```

**Saving**: 8 characters (36% reduction)

## Cognitive Complexity Analysis

### grep Requirements
- Remember recursive flag (-r)
- Specify target directory (.)
- Quote pattern for safety
- 3 concepts: tool, flag, pattern, target

### ripgrep Requirements
- Quote pattern for safety
- 2 concepts: tool, pattern
- Recursive is default behavior
- Current directory is default target

**Complexity Reduction**: 25% fewer concepts to remember

## Discoverability Analysis

### grep
- `grep --help` shows 50+ options
- Recursive search requires knowing -r flag
- Easy to forget target directory

### ripgrep
- Sensible defaults (recursive, current dir)
- `rg --help` is well-organized
- Common cases work without flags

**Discoverability**: rg wins due to better defaults

## Learning Curve Analysis

### grep
- Need to learn various flags: -r, -i, -n, -v, etc.
- Different behavior across systems
- Complex regex handling

### ripgrep
- Works out of box for common cases
- Consistent across platforms
- Better error messages and suggestions

**Learning Curve**: rg is significantly easier for newcomers
